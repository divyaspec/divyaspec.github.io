I am a software developer who is currently working as a back end java developer for a voice and cloud platform. With my past experience in IT support role, I developed a great enthusiasm to break into the development field. My interests are learning and becoming a better software developer. I enjoy being involved in design and architectural discussions of developing a product. I also enjoy sharing what I've learned through this blog.

For my static blog site, I used Poole since it provides you a mobile friendly design and complete set up for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site. There are lot of other themes that you can use from Jekyll sites. However I chose Poole since it support for a wide gamut of HTML elements and syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge.

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
