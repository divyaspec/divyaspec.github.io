I am a Software developer working for a voice based platform. I am really interested and fascinated to learn about technology and trying out different projects and I am also interested to collaborate on open source projects (<i>when I get the confidence and feel ready</i>). I am looking forward to learn and write about technical concepts that I find interesting and would be helpful for others.

For my static blog site, I used Poole since it gives you a mobile friendly design and complete set up for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site. There are lot of other themes that you can use from Jekyll sites. However I chose Poole since it support for a wide gamut of HTML elements and syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge.
There are currently three themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
