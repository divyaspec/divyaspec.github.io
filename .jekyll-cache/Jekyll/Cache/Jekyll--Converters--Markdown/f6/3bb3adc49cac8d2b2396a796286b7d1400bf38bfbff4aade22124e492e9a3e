I"Ý<p>I am a Software developer learning to build, test and solve problems. With my past experience in IT admin/support role, I developed a great enthusiasm to break into development field. My interests are learning and becoming a curious software engineer. I enjoy being involved in design and architectural discussions of developing a product. I also enjoy sharing what Iâ€™ve learned through this blog.</p>

<p>For my static blog site, I used Poole since it provides you a mobile friendly design and complete set up for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> site. There are lot of other themes that you can use from Jekyll sites. However I went for Poole since it supports for a wide gamut of HTML elements and syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyllâ€™s built-in support for Rouge.</p>

<p>There are currently two themes built on Poole:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com">Lanyon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I used Lanyon theme for my blog. You can view the folder structure on poole github repo and download the template to get started. The folder structure is very minimal so easy to customize the _config file. All the blog posts are in markdown format (a great tutorial for <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which is a very easy way to write content in web.</p>
