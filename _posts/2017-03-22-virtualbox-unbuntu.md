title: Installing Virtual Box and Unbuntu Image
---

## Setting up Virtual box on your windows machine

* Download the virtual box from this (link)[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads] here.
* Now download the ubuntu from this (link)[https://www.ubuntu.com/download] here.

After you have downloaded virtual box and ubuntu image, next step you will need to create a new image.

* Click create new image.
* Then you will allocate a memory on the new VM (I gave around 15MB).


The purpose of having a virtual box and downloading a ubuntu image in my windows worktop is to write a end to end acceptance tests using Gauge.

I will write a post about setting up gauge in windows worktop and how I started write end to end test cases for a node js application running inside the ubuntu server (inside a virtual box).
