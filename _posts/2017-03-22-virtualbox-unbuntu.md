title: Installing Virtual Box and Unbuntu Image
---

## Setting up Virtual box on your windows machine

* Download the virtual box from this [link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) here.
* Now download the ubuntu from this [link](https://www.ubuntu.com/download) here.

After you have downloaded virtual box and ubuntu image, next step you will need to create a new image.

You can then create new image as a set up process and also allocate a memory on the new VM (I gave around 15MB). This is a very basic quick set up for anyone to download virtual box and start running a ubuntu server.
