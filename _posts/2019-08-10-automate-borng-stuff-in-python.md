title: Web Scraping
---

I thought to start the new year to quickly whiz through and brush up my pythonic skills. Whats better way to learn than automating the boring stuff. Hence, I picked the book written by Al Sweigart, a great book for total beginners.

The most interesting stuff I would like to learn is how to web scrape web pages in Python. I have been using automation tool like Selenium at work, therefore using Selenium module to fill in forms and simulate mouse clicks in the browser would be a great way to kick start automating the boring stuff.
